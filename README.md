# How to use resource builder in the Flutter Calendar (SfCalendar)?

This example demonstrates how to use resource builder in the Flutter Calendar.

## Setting up the resource view header builder

In the Flutter Calendar, you can add custom widgets for resources by using the [resourceHeaderBuilder](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/ResourceViewHeaderBuilder.html) property of the calendar.

In this sample, we have created a resource view by setting the displayName, color, id, and image property of the CalendarResource. Then the resource view header has been customized with the help of the resourceHeaderBuilder property in the calendar.

Refer to our UG documentation to create [resources](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/resource-view) in the Calendar
